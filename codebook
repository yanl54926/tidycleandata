The run_analysis.R script will 
set workdirectory to desktop folder UCI HAR Dataset which containes downloaded and unzipped dataset from URL.
assign each data to variables
subject_train <- train/subjuect_train
x_train <- train/x_train 
y_train <- train/y_train
subject_test <- test/subject_test
x_test <- test/x_test
y_test <- test/y_test
x_data containes mergered data from x_train and x_test by using rbind()
y_data containes mergered data from y_train and y_test by using rbind()
subject_data containes mergered data from subject_train and subject_test by using rbind()
x_data_ms only extracted data from desired columns
y_data used activity name to name the acitivity in the dataset 
tidy_data is created by combined x_data_ms, y_data and subject_data 
then we give the according labels for the dataset which make the tide_data 
we then created a second independent tidy_data called data_new
